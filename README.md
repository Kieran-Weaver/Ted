# Ted

Ted is a RTF editor originally written by [nllgg.nl](https://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/), which uses backends of either GTK1, GTK2, or Motif as its GUI framework. The final version, 2.23, was released in 2013, and provides the initial commit for this repository. This repository intends to be a kind of Long-Term Support for Ted, fixing bugs and potentially doing porting work to remove deprecated code or add support for newer toolkits such as GTK3 or FLTK.

Ted 2.23, and any new fixes to it, are distributed under the GPL.
